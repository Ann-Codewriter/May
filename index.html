      HTML was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 at CERN (The European
      Organization for Nuclear Research). HTML refers to <br />Hypertext Markup
      Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating pages. HTML
      elements tell the browser how to <br />display the content.

      The World Wide Web (WWW) traces its root to ARPANET (Advanced Research
      Projects Agency Network) which was invented in the late 1960s.
      <br />ARPANET was a network for transmitting data between computers. In
      1989, Tim Berners-Lee developed HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) the
      <br />first web server and the first web browser, world wide web (www).

      HTTP transfers data across the web. In the early stages, websites were
      simple and static consisting of text with a few images. By the mid 1990s,
      browsers <br />and other programming languages like JavaScript were
      introduced to make web pages more dynamic, user driven and more popular.
      The web operates on a Client-<br />
      Server model. Clients (are typically web browsers) that sends requests web
      pages and servers (computers that store web data) respond by sending the
      requested information <br/>back to the clients.
